Usage of Data
The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to: Welcoming joining users (when enabled) and command handling.
No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

Stored Information
The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server:

`Guild IDs`
`Guild Names`
`Channel IDs`
`Role IDs`
`User IDs`
`Message Timestamps`
`Message IDs`
`Nicknames and Usernames`
`Last deleted message content (stored for a max of 2 hours or less, 19 entries allowed)`
`Last message edit history (stored for a max of 2 hours or less, 19 entries allowed)`

<h1>Why do you need the data and how is it used?</h1>

When a command is invoked, we store that message content for a maximum of 14 days for debugging purposes. We also store a maximum of 18 entries for edited messages and sniping messages that will expire in two hours or less in volatile memory.

Guild IDs, Channel IDs, Role IDs, User IDs and Message IDs are all stored for our system to aggregate values to find data.
